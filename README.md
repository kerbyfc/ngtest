# ngtest

My first ng project based on [supernova starter kit](https://github.com/orizens/supernova-angular-1.5.x-es6-starter)

#### Stages

1. ~~Bootstrap~~
3. ~~Add git repo~~
3. ~~Initial starter kit cleanup~~
4. ~~Navbar~~
5. ~~Books fetching~~
6. ~~Home (top) page implementation~~
7. ~~Book preview page implementation~~
8. Search page implementation<br/>
  8.1. ~~Show all books~~<br/>
  8.2. ~~Add filter control~~<br/>
  8.3. ~~Sorting by name & book rating~~
9. ~~Write e2e tests~~
10. ~~Cleanup~~

##### Roadmap
1. More tests (search page, 404 redirect and so on) ~ 2oct
2. Investigate sinon problem for existing unit tests (it's not working out of the box) ~ 2oct
2. More e2e tests, cucumber-template & cucumber-tsflow-suite need more contributions ~ 10oct`*`
3. Improve mock, they are poor in case of description and image, some book pages are so ugly... ~ 10oct`*`
4. Spend more time for ng best practices and apply new knowledges to existing code base ~10oct`*`

`*` - if i'll change my work and have time for this...
